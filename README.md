# MailScripts

I use DEVONthink as primary document, email and personal information management (PIM) system.
The MailScripts project is a collection of scripts used to connect various - and really gorgeous - macOS applications with DEVONthink to automate daily workflows.

MailScripts was originally created to automate my document management workflows - in particular for the sake of digitalization of all my paper documents - started somewhere back between 2010 and 2015.

Right now MailScripts still supports me in daily document management workflows for all paper documents (mostly for postal mails & receipts) but it is also the foundation for all my email and PIM related workflows.
