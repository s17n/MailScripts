# Overview

MailScripts is a collection of scripts to improve my document management workflow with DEVONthink, which acts as leading system for all documents (document type .pdf or .eml) mangaged with it.  Improvements include:

- import of Mail messages (push & pull)
- auto-lookup for dates, receiver, sender and more in scanned paper documents or imported PDFs
- catagorize mail messages by contact group of sender
- auto-renaming / tagging based on dates lookup and similar records using DEVONthink's 'compare records' feature 
- archive records to a dedicated  DEVONthink archive group
