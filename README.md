# MailScripts

I use DEVONthink as primary document, email and personal information management system.
MailScripts is a collection of scripts - mostly AppleScript - used to connect various gorgeous macOS applications with DEVONthink to automate daily workflows.

MailScripts was originally created to automate my document management workflows - in particular for the sake of digitalization of all my paper documents - started somewhere back between 2010 and 2015.

Right now it still supports me in daily document management workflows for all paper documents (mostly for postal mails & receipts) and all kinds of digital documents as well. 

Apple's decision to cut off Mail plug-ins with Sonoma was terrible in the short-term (I used Apple Mail with plug-ins) but glorious in the mid-term (at least to me) - because it forced me to look for alternatives - which I have also found in DEVONthink. I still use Apple Mail of course for ending, receiving and showing emails - but all email management is done completely in DEVONthink. MailScripts include scripts for intergation with Mail.app and mail-oriented workflows.

Last but not least I use DEVONthink as personal information management system for all the rest of digital assets that does exist in my life.
