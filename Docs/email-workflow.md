# E-Mail Workflow

Apple's decision to cut off Mail plug-ins with Sonoma was terrible in the short-term (I used Apple Mail with plug-ins) but it seems to be glorious in the long-term (so at least to me) - because it forced me to look for alternatives. I found it in DEVONthink. 

I use DEVONthink as primary email management system. Of course I still use Apple Mail but it only acts more or less as a 'proxy' to send and receive mails. All email management - tagging, grouping, _getting things done_, archiving - is done completely in DEVONthink.

MailScripts include scripts for intergation with Apple Mail and other macOS applications to improve mail-oriented workflows. This includes the basic stuff like importing and archiving but also some tiny pieces of code for action-oriented worklows with emails and the content of emails. I get a lot of mails - I guess like everybody in today's world - and this helps me to manage them and the projects behind.

The e-mail workflow scripts includes:
- auto-import of mail messages (push & pull)
- auto-catagorize by contact group of sender
- tagging 
- 'getting things done' scripts
- archiving
